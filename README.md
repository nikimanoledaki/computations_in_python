# Computations with Algorithms and Data Structures

## Description
Exercises from the CS60001 and CS0002 courses at MIT, the syllabus of which are publicly available [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm) and [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/index.html). The lectures are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nykOeWgQcHM&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA). I completed the majority of the readings for these courses, which share the same textbook - *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, 2nd Edition*. I completed the readings and watched the lectures as a way to do an in depth revision of data structures, algorithms, computational thinking, and Big O notation.
