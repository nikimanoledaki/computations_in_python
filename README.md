# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Description
Exercises from the CS6.0001 course at MIT, the syllabus of which is publicly available [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm). The lectures are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nykOeWgQcHM&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA). The textbook used is *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, 2nd Edition*. I decided to follow this course as a recap and extension of the fundamentals, most of which I learned  at Makers Academy back in October.
