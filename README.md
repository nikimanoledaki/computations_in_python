# Computations with Algorithms and Data Structures

## Description
Exercises from the CS6.0001 course at MIT, the syllabus of which is publicly available [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm). The lectures are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nykOeWgQcHM&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA). I completed the readings from the course's textbook, which is *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, 2nd Edition*. I completed the readings and watched the lectures of this course as a way to do an in depth revision of data structures, algorithms, computational thinking, and Big O notation.
